## Rename Slippi Files
a repackaging of https://github.com/mtimkovich/slippi-renamer in Electron.

EXTREMELY barebones but functional, no Node or console commands required.

## Usage
- download and run the .exe from the releases tab
- choose your folder
- all .slp files within the folder and subfolders will be renamed


Ideally I will replace slp_rename.js with my own renamer and allow some options. One day.
